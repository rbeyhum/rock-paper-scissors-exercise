# Rock Paper Scissors Exercise

This is the README.md file. It will explain both the steps taken to write code and setting up an environment. 

## Repository Setup

Firstly, I created a remote repository using the GitHub online interface. Then, I cloned the repository to GitHub Desktop software and chose the *Desktop* as a location to download the repo. This was done through GitHub Desktop itself and not through the command line. Moreover, using the text editor *VS Code*, I created a file called game.py which will contain all the necessary code needed to run the **Rock Paper Scissors Exercise**.
Using the command line, I navigated to the repo from there using the following command:
```sh
cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

## Environment Setup

This step entails the process of creating a virtual environment locally using the command-line. 
```sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8
conda activate my-game-env
```
